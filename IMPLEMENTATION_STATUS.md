# Implementation Status Tracking

## Overall Status

The CURSED programming language compiler is currently in **Stage 1 of development** (Bootstrap Compiler in Rust). Many core features are implemented, but several key components still need work.

### Implementation Progress

- **Lexer and Parser**: Mostly complete. Can parse most language constructs including most Gen Z slang keywords.
- **AST**: Complete for most language constructs.
- **Type System**: Partially implemented. Basic types and composite types work, but generics and interfaces need more work.
- **LLVM Codegen**: Partially implemented. Can generate code for basic language features but has gaps.
- **Runtime Support**: Basic GC and runtime features are implemented, but need enhancement.
- **Standard Library**: Minimal implementation, many packages not yet implemented.

### Major Features Status

- **Basic Types**: Fully implemented
- **Functions**: Fully implemented
- **Control Flow**: Mostly implemented
  - `periodt` while loops implementation completed and connected
  - Range clauses implementation improved and connected in `src/codegen/llvm/range_clause_fixed.rs` 
  - Container iteration partially implemented with support for arrays and placeholder code for other container types
- **Concurrency**: Improved implementation
  - Goroutines (`stan`): Basic structure exists with improved connection to expressions
  - Channels (`dm`): Implementation significantly improved with proper runtime FFI integration
    - Added FFI runtime functions in `src/runtime/channel.rs` for proper channel operations
    - Connected LLVM code generation to runtime functions for channel creation, send and receive operations
    - Implemented better structured logging throughout channel operations
  - `concurrenz` package: Interface defined in stdlib and connected to channel implementation
- **Structs**: Fully implemented with enhanced features
  - Struct field type inference: Added support for fields without explicit type annotations
  - Fields can be declared without types, and the compiler will infer them from initializers
  - Parser enhanced to support both explicit and inferred field types
  - Type system integration for propagating inferred types
- **Interfaces**: Mostly implemented
  - Interface definition/implementation: Core functionality in `src/codegen/llvm/interface_implementation.rs`
  - Type assertions: Fully implemented and integrated through `src/codegen/llvm/type_assertion_implementation.rs`
    - Fixed type assertion integration in expression compiler to use proper error handling
    - Added registration hook in LlvmCodeGenerator initialization for consistent usage
    - Improved error propagation through proper `?` operator usage
  - Dynamic dispatch: Framework exists but needs optimization
- **Generics**: Partially implemented
  - Parser support: Working in `src/parser/preprocessor.rs`
  - Monomorphization: Substantial framework exists but incomplete
    - Manager: Basic tracking of specializations in both `src/codegen/monomorphization.rs` and a simpler version in `src/codegen/llvm/monomorphization.rs`
    - Type instantiation: Type parameter substitution in `src/core/generic_instantiation.rs` is functional for basic types
    - Function specialization: Fully implemented in `src/codegen/llvm/function_monomorphization.rs` with proper type substitution, parameter handling, and function body compilation
    - Struct specialization: Skeleton implementation in `src/codegen/llvm/struct_monomorphization.rs` missing proper field layout
    - Field accessors: Scaffolding in `src/codegen/llvm/enhanced_monomorphization.rs:generate_field_accessors()` but not integrated
    - Constraint checking: Comprehensive implementation with consistent behavior:
      - Added a central interface registry in `src/core/interface_registry.rs` to track type-interface implementations
      - Both `src/codegen/monomorphization.rs:check_constraint()` and `src/codegen/llvm/enhanced_monomorphization.rs:check_constraint()` use the registry
      - Consistent error handling: both implementations return `Err` for unsupported types
      - Registry supports both primitive types and user-defined interface implementations
      - Proper integration with the type checker's interface implementation system as a fallback
      - Registry tracks which structs implement which interfaces with an efficient lookup system
      - Added comprehensive tests in `tests/interface_registry_test.rs` to verify functionality
    - Tests: Many test files including `tests/generics_monomorphization_test.rs` and `tests/struct_monomorphization_test.rs` exist but use simplified implementations
- **Package System**: Fully implemented
- **Memory Management**: Fully implemented with key enhancements
  - Garbage collection: Comprehensive implementation in `src/memory/gc.rs`
  - Cycle detection: Advanced implementation in `src/memory/cycle_detector.rs`
  - Incremental collection: Reduces GC pauses during program execution
  - Object finalization: Proper resource cleanup during garbage collection

## Implementation Status Report - May 10, 2025

I've implemented a comprehensive solution for generic interface constraint checking. This addresses one of the key limitations in the monomorphization system that was preventing proper constraint validation for generic type parameters. The main changes include:

1. Added a dedicated `interface_registry.rs` module that provides a central registry for tracking interface implementations
2. Updated the monomorphization system to use this registry for constraint checking
3. Ensured consistent error handling between different constraint checking implementations
4. Connected the type checker's interface implementation system with the monomorphization system
5. Fixed inconsistencies between `Ok(false)` and `Err` return values for unsatisfied constraints

Implemented improvements include:

1. A flexible InterfaceRegistry struct that tracks which types implement which interfaces
2. Efficient lookup mechanisms using HashMap for fast constraint checking
3. Support for both primitive types and user-defined interface implementations
4. Integration between the registry and the monomorphization system for consistent behavior
5. Comprehensive tests to verify that constraint checking works correctly across different scenarios

This implementation resolves the following issues from the previous status:

1. Inconsistent behavior between different constraint checking implementations
2. Lack of support for user-defined interface implementations
3. Missing registry to track interface implementations
4. Poor integration with the type checker's interface implementation system
5. Inconsistent error handling for unsatisfied constraints

Next steps will focus on:

1. Expanding the registry to support generic interface implementations
2. Adding automatic registration of interface implementations during type checking
3. Improving performance with caching mechanisms for constraint checking results
4. Implementing better error messages for constraint failures

With the interface constraint checking infrastructure now in place, we're in a good position to fully implement generic type constraints across the entire compiler system.
