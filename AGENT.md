## Development Commands

```bash
# Build compiler
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Compile CURSED program
./target/debug/cursed --compile program.csd

# Execute CURSED program (JIT)
./target/debug/cursed program.csd

# Run with clean environment
./build-with-fixed-env.sh

# Test specific integration (with proper ignores for JIT)
cargo test jit_integration_tests -- --ignored

# Compile CURSED program to native executable
cargo run --bin cursed compile program.csd

# Run CURSED programs (note: JIT has known LLVM initialization issues)
cargo run --bin cursed program.csd
```

## Development Environment

Uses https://devenv.sh to provide development dependencies. These are defined in  devenv.nix. You will need to run "direnv allow" after making a change then restart bash sessions.

## Language Features

### Tuples
- Basic syntax: `(1, "hello", based)`
- Access elements: `tuple.0`, `tuple.1`, `tuple.2`
- Destructuring: `(a, b, c) = tuple`
- Tests: `tests/tuple_tests.rs` (all 14 tests pass)
- Status: Works in interpretation mode, may have LLVM codegen issues

### Boolean Literals
- Specification-compliant syntax: `based` (true) and `sus` (false)
- Boolean type: `lit` 
- Usage: `sus flag lit = based` or `sus flag lit = sus`
- Tests: Boolean literals work correctly in both variable declarations and expressions
- Status: Fully compliant with language specification

### Mixed Arithmetic Operations
- Mixed Integer-Float arithmetic fully supported in interpretation mode
- All arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and comparison (<, >, ==, etc.) operations work
- Automatic type promotion: integers converted to floats for mixed operations
- Example: `5 * 3.14` works correctly in interpretation mode
- Status: Works perfectly in interpretation mode, compilation mode works for non-constant expressions

### Character Type
- Character type: `sip` (single character values)
- Character literals: `'a'`, `'Z'`, `'1'`, `'@'`
- Escape sequences: `'\n'`, `'\t'`, `'\\'`, `'\''`
- Variable declaration: `sus ch sip = 'x'`
- String interpolation and comparison operations supported
- Status: Fully functional in both interpretation and compilation modes

## Known Issues

### JIT Execution Environment
- JIT integration tests require `#[ignore = "Requires LLVM environment setup"]` to prevent segfaults
- LLVM initialization can cause SIGSEGV in test environments
- Native compilation works perfectly via `cursed compile`
- JIT infrastructure is preserved for future activation when LLVM issues are resolved
