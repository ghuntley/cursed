# CURSED Full Implementation Restoration Plan

## Current Status: ⚠️ ACTIVE RESTORATION

**Goal**: Restore full CURSED language implementation with all advanced features from minimal working state.

## Progress Report

### ✅ COMPLETED STEPS:
1. **Backup Current Working Minimal** - Saved to `src/lib.minimal_working_backup.rs` and `Cargo.minimal_backup.toml`
2. **Restore Full Configuration** - Replaced `lib.rs` with `lib.full.rs` and `Cargo.toml` with `Cargo.full.toml`
3. **Module Structure Restoration** - Moved disabled modules to active:
   - `ast_disabled` → `ast`
   - `runtime_disabled_again` → `runtime` 
   - `optimization_disabled` → `optimization`
   - `codegen_disabled` → `codegen`
   - `parser_disabled` → `parser`
   - `memory_disabled` → `memory`

### 🔧 CURRENTLY FIXING:
- **Syntax Errors**: Multiple malformed async/await patterns missing semicolons
- **Import Issues**: Invalid type declarations like `Netcrate::error::Result<T>`
- **Module Conflicts**: Duplicate file/directory module issues

### 🎯 NEXT STEPS:
1. **Fix Remaining Syntax Errors** - Clean up async_io.rs and database/error.rs
2. **Enable Core Modules** - Ensure all core language features compile
3. **Test Basic Functionality** - Verify minimal CURSED programs can execute
4. **Enable Advanced Features**:
   - Complete LLVM optimization pipeline
   - Goroutine runtime system with channels
   - Comprehensive cryptography suite
   - Package management system
   - Web framework with HTTP server
   - Debugging and profiling tools
   - Complete standard library

## Architecture Overview
The full CURSED language includes:
- Gen Z slang syntax with Go-like grammar
- LLVM-based compilation with advanced optimization
- Goroutine concurrency model
- Comprehensive cryptography (post-quantum ready)
- Full-featured web framework
- Enterprise debugging and profiling tools
- Complete standard library with networking, database, etc.

## Error Summary
Currently resolving 24+ compilation errors primarily related to:
- Async/await syntax in stdlib/io/async_io.rs
- Type declaration syntax issues
- Module structure conflicts
